Expects census districts to be under ShapeFiles subdirectory and demographics data downloaded from My Congressional District to be under Demographics Data.

Census data should be in separated CSVs named after the state (eg "texas.csv") and contain all districts.

Also requires output from FIPS2JSON to be in directory and named states.json
